# Which contract is right for you?

This page is designed to help you decide which contract suits your needs.

thirdweb pre-built contracts can be categorized into four groups:

1. **NFTs** (Non-Fungible Tokens)
2. **Tokens** (Fungible Tokens)
3. **Marketplace**
4. **Other** (such as DAO tools)

### What does "drop" mean?

**Drop** refers to the tokens in a contract being "dropped" or **released** under a certain set of conditions.
Whenever you see the word "drop" in thirdweb, it means the tokens in this smart contract can be made available to be **claimed** by others.

## NFTs

NFTs are a type of token that follow the
[ERC-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) "non-fungible" standard, where each token is unique,
or the
[ERC-1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155) "semi-fungible" standard, where there can be multiple owners per NFT. i.e.
there can be multiple copies of the same NFT.

thirdweb currently has **four** types of NFT contracts:

1. NFT Drop
2. NFT Collection
3. Edition Drop
4. Edition Collection

Below is a helpful table to demonstrate the differences between them:

| Contract       | Type     | Multiple copies of NFT | Claimable by other people |
| -------------- | -------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
| NFT Drop       | ERC-721  | ❌                     | ✔️                        |
| NFT Collection | ERC-721  | ❌                     | ❌                        |
| Edition Drop   | ERC-1155 | ✔️                     | ✔️                        |
| Edition        | ERC-1155 | ✔️                     | ❌                        |

</div>

## Tokens

Tokens follow the [ERC-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) "fungible token" standard.

thirdweb currently has **two** types of Token contracts:

1. Token
2. Token Drop

If you want to release your tokens for a price or with [claim phases](/pre-built-contracts/nft-drop#setting-claim-phases),
the Token Drop contract is best suited for you.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}>

| Contract   | Type   | Claimable by other people |
| ---------- | ------ | ------------------------- |
| Token      | ERC-20 | ❌                        |
| Token Drop | ERC-20 | ✔️                        |
