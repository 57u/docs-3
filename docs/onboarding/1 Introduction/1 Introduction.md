## How thirdweb simplifies Web3 development

Building web3 apps is hard, and the cost of mistakes can be extremely high.

**thirdweb** provides a suite of tools for you to use at every step of the development stack to enable and enhance your web3 applications.

All of thirdweb’s tools are [open source](https://github.com/orgs/thirdweb-dev) and completely server-less. This means we’re not using databases behind the scenes, or any centralization that relies solely on thirdweb for your applications to work.

Let’s explore thirdweb’s three core pillars:

1. Contracts
2. SDKs
3. The Dashboard

**Next up**

We’ll show you how you can deploy your first smart contract with thirdweb and easily connect it into your apps with just a few simple lines of code.
