# Contracts

Smart Contracts are the fundamental layer of any web3 tech stack, and they’re responsible for storing your applications data on the blockchain.

![Thirdweb Contract Layer](../assets/contract-layer.png)

Any contract deployed on thirdweb is 100% owned by the wallet that deploys it. Meaning if thirdweb were to ever shut down, your smart contracts are still available to you on the blockchain.

You can deploy one of our [pre-built contracts](/pre-built-contracts) onto a blockchain of your choice, or you could extend your custom-built contracts using [thirdweb deploy](/thirdweb-deploy) to enhance your own contract with all of thirdweb's capabilities.

## Pre-Built Contracts

Our [pre-built contracts](/pre-built-contracts) are audited by top-tier auditing firms such as 0xmacro to provide you with full confidence in their capabilities and safety.

All of thirdweb’s contracts are also [open-source](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/contracts), meaning you can review these contracts yourself and explore the intricacies and details within them at any time.

Not only that, it's around **10x cheaper** to deploy thirdweb's pre-built contracts compared to deploying them yourself, using our proxy contracts.

## Custom Contracts - thirdweb Deploy

[thirdweb deploy](/thirdweb-deploy) is our tool for enhancing your own smart contracts with thirdweb's capabilities. It provides you with a simple way to deploy, interact with, and manage your smart contracts, all without exposing your private key.
