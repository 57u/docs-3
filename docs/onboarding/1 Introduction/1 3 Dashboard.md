### Dashboard

thirdweb's dashboard is an easy-to-use tool letting you configure permissions, set platform and royalty fees, and share access to your contracts with your team members.

Our dashboard natively supports multi-sig wallets including Gnosis safe, making it perfect for teams and organizations to access and configure your smart contracts with.

The dashboard also enables you to configure and deploy any of thirdweb’s [pre-built contracts](/pre-built-contracts), and perform common functionalities such as minting without writing any code.

Within the dashboard, we provide simple code snippets for you to get started, and give you visual representations of what is happening on your smart contract; like all the NFTs that have been minted in your collection, or what is currently listed on your marketplace.

You can also perform common admin operations like burning your NFTs, removing listings from your marketplace, or deleting your smart contract completely. Within the dashboard, you’re able to manage your teams payments and distribute the funds that you’ve received from within your smart contract with the click of a button.
