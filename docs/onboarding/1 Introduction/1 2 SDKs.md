### SDKs

We provide SDKs to interact directly with your smart contracts in your favorite languages, including:

- [JavaScript (TypeScript)](/typescript)
- [React.JS](/react)
- [Python](/python)
- _Go (coming soon)_

![Thirdweb SDK Layer](../assets/sdk-layer.png)

thirdweb's SDKs connect your application to your smart contracts, which allows you to easily read and write data to them.

Within the SDK, we do all the heavy lifting, like connecting to the blockchain via RPC, configuring which networks you want to support, fetching data from IPFS, caching results from the blockchain for faster responses, and much more.

In addition to the pre-built functionalities, we generate additional SDK capabilities dynamically if you're using a custom contract.
