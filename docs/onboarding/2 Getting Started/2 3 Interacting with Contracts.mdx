# Interacting with Smart Contracts

Now that you've [installed and configured](/getting-started/creating-a-web3-app/) the SDK, you're ready to start interacting with your smart contracts (and more)!

## Getting Your Smart Contract

The first step is to get your contract.

You can do this by using its contract address, which you can find in the dashboard.

![Copy Contract Address from dashboard](./assets/copy-contract-address.png)

Copy this contract address, and use it to get an instance of your smart contract in code.

For example, we can get our NFT Drop contract using the code below:

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet
  contract={"NFTDrop"}
  name={"initializing the SDK"}
  isGetContractCode
  showHr={false}
/>

## Using Your Smart Contract

Now you're ready to use the functions of your smart contract.

### Read Data

You can read data from the contract like so:

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"NFTDrop"} name={"getAll"} showHr={false} />

### Write Data (Create Transaction)

You can write data to the contract if there is a connected wallet, or instantiated the SDK with a signer/private key.

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"NFTDrop"} name={"claimTo"} />
