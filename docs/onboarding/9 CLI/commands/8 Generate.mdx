# Generate

Detects all contract addresses in your project, then fetches and stores each smart contract&rsquo;s ABI in memory (inside `node_modules`);
improving the performance of the SDK when using functions such as [`getContract`](/typescript/sdk.thirdwebsdk.smartcontract) and
[`useContract`](/react/react.usecontract).

Once the ABIs are cached locally, the SDK becomes **strongly typed** when interacting with your smart contracts.
Providing you with Intellisense and type-checking when using functions such as
[`contract.call`](/typescript/sdk.smartcontract.call), in the [TypeScript SDK](/typescript),
or [`useContractRead`](/react/react.usecontractread), and [`useContractWrite`](/react/react.usecontractwrite)
in the [React SDK](/react).

```bash
npx thirdweb generate
```

## Usage

This command recursively checks all files in your project for valid smart contract addresses and fetches the ABIs for each contract.
The ABIs are then stored locally in the projects `node_modules/@thirdweb-dev/generated-abis` directory.

Functions that require the fetching of a smart contract such as `getContract` and `useContract` will now use the cached ABIs instead of
fetching them each time the function is called. This improves the performance of your application and allows the SDK to become strongly
typed when interacting with your smart contracts.

```bash
npx thirdweb generate [options]
```

## Options

<div>
  {CLI.generate.map(({ flags, description }) => (
    <CLIOptions flags={flags} description={description} />
  ))}
</div>
