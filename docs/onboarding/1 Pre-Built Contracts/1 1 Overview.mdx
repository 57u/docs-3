Explore is a directory of smart contracts that have been carefully curated in collaboration with protocols, communities, and include thirdweb's ready-to-deploy contracts. With Explore, developers can deploy smart contracts to any EVM chain without exposing their wallet's private keys.

Using Explore, developers can discover unique contracts that suit their specific use cases. Once a contract has been deployed, a dashboard is provided for easy interaction and management of the contract. These contracts can also be used with SDKs to build applications for end-users.

Protocols and companies can easily publish their contracts on Explore, allowing developers to discover and deploy them with ease. If you're interested in deploying your contract on Explore, please fill out our [partnership form](https://form.typeform.com/to/FAwehBFl?typeform-source=thirdweb.com).

### Key Features

Explore offers several key features, including:

- Open source contracts that are free to deploy (excluding gas fees)
- A directory of contracts that can be easily deployed to any EVM compatible blockchain
- Accessible audit reports for each audited contract, ensuring transparency and trustworthiness
- A wide selection of ready-to-deploy contracts covering popular use cases such as NFTs, tokens, DAOs, marketplaces, airdrops, staking, and more
- Unlock access to the [Dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard) for contract management, analytics, and interaction.

### Benefits

Explore contracts offer several benefits, including:

- Full ownership by the contract deployer, giving you complete control over your assets
- Cost savings of up to 10x compared to standard deployment methods with thirdweb's ready-to-deploy contracts
- Streamlined deployment process, reducing friction and making it easier to get your contracts up and running.

## Ready-to-Deploy Contracts

### How thirdweb’s Ready-to-Deploy Contracts Work

Each contract makes use of extensions available in thirdweb’s Solidity SDK and come with a standard set of features that enable fine-grained control over the contract's behavior, such as:

- Contract metadata
- Permission controls
- Royalty and platform fees

When using Ready-to-Deply contracts under the hood you are creating a **proxy contract**;
which reduces the gas cost by **~90%**!

This works by having our smart contracts run the underlying logic, meaning you only deploy the code that is unique to _your_ contract. This is possible since all ready-to-deploy contracts run the same logic for actions such as minting, transferring, and burning tokens.
