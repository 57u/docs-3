An NFT Drop contract is a type of smart contract that is designed to allow creators to release a collection of unique NFTs using the ERC721A standard.

The NFT Drop contract enables creators to define a set of conditions called claim phases in a sequence that specifies when and how users can claim an NFT from the drop. These conditions can include allowlists, release dates, and claim limits, among others.

### Use Cases & Examples

The NFT Drop contract has a variety of practical use cases, including:

- Releasing a PFP (profile picture) collection where each NFT has a unique combination of traits
- Creating a series of NFTs featuring your artwork, and allowing your community to mint them for a price
- Hosting a restricted-access NFT drop, where only a specific list of wallets can claim NFTs

### Understanding NFT Drop vs Collection

Compared to an NFT collection, which requires end-users to mint the NFTs themselves, the NFT Drop contract allows creators to "pre-populate" the NFTs metadata to enable [lazy-minting](/glossary/lazy-minting).
