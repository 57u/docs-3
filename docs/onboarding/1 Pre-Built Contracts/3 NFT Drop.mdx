The NFT Drop contract is ideal when you want to release a collection of unique NFTs using the ERC721A standard.

It allows you to define a set of conditions called claim phases in a sequence that defines when and how your users can claim an NFT from your drop; including allowlists, release dates, claim limits, and delayed reveals.

### NFT Drop Use Cases

Common use cases for the NFT Drop contract include:

- Release a PFP Collection where each NFT has a different combination of traits

- Release NFTs of your artwork, and have your community mint them for a price

- Create a restricted-access NFT drop, where only a specified list of wallets can claim NFTs
