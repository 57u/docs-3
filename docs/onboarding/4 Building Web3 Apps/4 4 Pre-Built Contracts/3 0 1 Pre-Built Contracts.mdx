In case you missed it, we outlined what pre-built contracts are and how they work in [Building Pre-Built Contracts](/smart-contracts/pre-built-contracts-overview).

This page adds some more context about how you can utilize them when building an application.

## Contract Extensions

Each Pre-Built contract consists of implementations of the [contract extensions](/thirdweb-deploy/contract-extensions)
that are in our [Solidity SDK](/thirdweb-deploy/contract-extensions). This allows you to use the SDKs with both custom _and_ pre-built contracts, as they
use the same underlying Solidity interfaces.

### Why It's Designed This Way

Let's look at an example.

Our [NFT Collection](/pre-built-contracts/nft-collection) contract extends our [ITokenERC721](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/contracts/blob/main/contracts/interfaces/token/ITokenERC721.sol)
interface; which requires the implementation of the `mintTo` function _(and a few others too)_.
You could also write a custom contract that implements the `ITokenERC721` interface, and implement the `mintTo` function with some different logic, such as adding some on-chain metadata.

In this scenario, both the custom contract and the pre-built contract will unlock the "Mint" button on the dashboard,
and also be able to use the SDK's `contract.nft.mint.to` function; which handles the complexity of minting NFTs such as uploading and pinning metadata to IPFS for you.

Since each contract is made up of [contract extensions](/thirdweb-deploy/contract-extensions), our docs are designed to be relevant to both pre-built contract users and
custom contract users; and are therefore separated at a contract extension level to avoid repeating the same information across multiple pages.
