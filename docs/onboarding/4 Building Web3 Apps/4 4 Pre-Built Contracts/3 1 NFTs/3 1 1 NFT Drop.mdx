thirdweb's drop contracts **lazy mint** your NFTs and make them available to be claimed by your users.

The NFT Drop contract is best used when you want to release a **1-of-1** or **1-of-many** NFT collection,
such as a PFP (profile picture) collection, and uses the [ERC721 Standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721).
The NFT Drop contract allows you to define the conditions for when and how your users can mint an NFT,
including allowlists, release dates, claim limits, and delayed reveals.

When you add NFTs to your drop contract, they are **not** minted at this point.
You prepare everything for your users so that _they_ can mint the NFT(s).
This means the user who claims the NFT is the one who mints it,
and it is minted into their wallet. By default, the user is the one who pays the gas fees.

You could use the NFT Drop contract to:

- Release a PFP Collection where each NFT has a different combination of traits
- Release NFTs of your artwork, and have your community mint them for a price
- Create a restricted-access NFT drop, where only a certain list of wallets can claim it

## Contract Extensions

Below is a list of the [contract extensions](/thirdweb-deploy/contract-extensions) that the NFT Drop contract implements.

This means you can use any of the functionality in these extensions when interacting with the NFT Drop.

## Create an NFT Drop Contract

Learn how to create any of thirdweb's pre-built contracts via the [Deploying Contracts page](/getting-started/deploying-contracts).

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"ContractDeployer"} name={"deployNFTDrop"} />

<!-- ## Feature Sets -->
<!-- TODO: Explain how lazy minting works and what contract implementations are used on this contract here. -->

## Getting the contract in your application

To start using your NFT Drop contract inside your application, you'll need to use its contract address. You can get the contract address from the [dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard).

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet
  contract={"NFTDrop"}
  name={"initializing the SDK"}
  isGetContractCode
/>
