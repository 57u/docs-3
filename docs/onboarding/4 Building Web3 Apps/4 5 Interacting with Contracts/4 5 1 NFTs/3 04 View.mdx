# Viewing NFTs

Get the metadata and the current owner of NFTs with different filters and criteria.

### One NFT

Get one NFT including it's `owner`, and the NFT's `metadata` that is resolved from IPFS for you.

- Related Contract Extension: [ERC721](/thirdweb-deploy/contract-extensions/erc721).

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"NFTDrop"} name={"get"} />

### All NFTs

Get all NFTs in the contract with their `owner` and `metadata` that is resolved from IPFS for you.

By default, this returns the first `100` tokens. It accepts an optional parameter that you can use for pagination. Learn how by viewing the SDK documentation.

### NFTs owned by a specific wallet

Provide a wallet address to get all NFTs owned by that wallet, including the `owner` and the `metadata`.

If no wallet address is provided, the function will use the connected wallet address.

Returns an empty array if no NFTs are owned by the wallet.
