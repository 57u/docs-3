# Solidity SDK

The Solidity SDK offers contract extensions that allows you to:

- Build smart contracts more easily by implementing features from our contracts.
- Enable the thirdweb SDK and dashboard to work with your contracts.

To install it into your Solidity project, run the following command:

```bash
npm install @thirdweb-dev/contracts
```

@adam TODO: Explain how thirdweb helps at all parts of contract development, speed up building, analysis, deployment, versioning, etc.

## Using Contract Extensions

The typical flow of using Contract Extensions is:

1. Import the contract extension you want to use.
2. Make your contract implement that extension (usually "`Contract is TheExtensionName`").
3. Implement any required functions to satisfy the interface.

That's it! You will then be able to use the feature in the SDK and in the dashboard.

TODO: @adam we should add some of the stuff you said on the Stripe guide here. Like the "cards" on how to do common stuff.
Like maybe 1. Create your own NFT Collection? 2. Do stuff, etc.
