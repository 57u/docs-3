# Solidity SDK

The Solidity SDK allows you to build your own smart contracts by providing:

- Base contracts that you can build upon, such as [ERC721Base](/todo).
- Contract extensions you can implement, such as [Permission Controls](/todo) and [Royalty Fees](/todo).

By building with our Solidity SDK, you:

- Gain access to powerful, [audited](/todo) contract extensions you can import and implement in your smart contracts.
- Unlock the features of [Dashboard](/todo) and [SDK](/todo) on your own smart contracts.

Each feature you implement in your smart contracts unlocks functionality in both the dashboard and SDK to help you build applications on top of them.
For example, if you implement the [IDKMintSomethjingTODO](/todo), you'll unlock the `mint` button in the dashboard and
can use the [mint](/todo) function in the SDK; which automatically uploads and pins your metadata to IPFS!
