# Solidity SDK

The Solidity SDK provides a powerful set of contract extensions that allow you to:

- Build smart contracts more easily by importing features into your contract.
- Use the dashboard and SDK to build web3 applications on top of your Solidity code.

To install the SDK into your Solidity project, run the following command:

```bash
npm install @thirdweb-dev/contracts
```

This allows you to `import` any of the functionality that we provide, and utilize them in your own contracts; enabling you to
pick and choose which features you want to include.
