# Creating the Marketplace Contract

In this example, you will learn how to create your very own **NFT Marketplace**!

We'll create an application with the following capabilities:

- A way to list NFTs for direct sale or for auction.
- A way for users to make bids and buy NFTs.

## Demo

At the end, you'll have a production ready NFT marketplace, that your users can list and buy NFTs from.
