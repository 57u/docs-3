The `ThirdwebProvider` is a wrapper component that provides access to all of the SDK&rsquo;s hooks and UI components.
It utilizes the [Provider Pattern](https://www.patterns.dev/posts/provider-pattern/)
to share data to all of the components that are nested within it.

## Usage

```jsx title="App.jsx"
import { ThirdwebProvider } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
import { Ethereum } from "@thirdweb-dev/chains";

function MyApp() {
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider network={Ethereum.chainId} chains={[Ethereum]}>
      <YourApp />
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
}
```

## Configuration

The `ThirdwebProvider` component lets you control what networks you want users to connect to,
what types of wallets can connect to your app,
and the settings for the [Typescript SDK](https://docs.thirdweb.com/typescript), such as a custom RPC URL.

### Configure Network

The `network` field is suitable for when your smart contracts are deployed to a **single** network,
and this is the network you want users to connect to.

1. Import the network you want to connect to from the `@thirdweb-dev/chains` package.
2. Pass the `chainId` of the network to the `network` prop of the `ThirdwebProvider`.
3. Pass the network in an array to the `chains` prop of the `ThirdwebProvider`.

```jsx title="App.jsx"
import { ThirdwebProvider } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
// highlight-start
import { Polygon } from "@thirdweb-dev/chains";
// highlight-end

function MyApp() {
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider
      // highlight-start
      network={Polygon.chainId} // Required. Network you want users to connect/switch to.
      chains={[Polygon]} // Required. Array of networks you want to allow users to connect to.
      // highlight-end
    >
      <YourApp />
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
}
```

### Custom Networks

If your network is not included in the `@thirdweb-dev/chains` package,
you can provide the network information yourself.

1. Provide the chain ID as the value of the `network` prop.
2. Create a new `Chain` object and pass it in an array to the `chains` prop.

```js
import { ThirdwebProvider } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider
      network={59140}
      chains={[
        {
          // === Required information for connecting to the network === \\
          chainId: 59140, // Chain ID of the network
          // Array of RPC URLs to use
          rpc: ["<your-rpc-url-here>"],

          // === Information for adding the network to your wallet (how it will appear for first time users) === \\
          // Information about the chains native currency (i.e. the currency that is used to pay for gas)
          nativeCurrency: {
            decimals: 18,
            name: "Consensys ETH",
            symbol: "crETH",
          },
          shortName: "Consensys zkEVM", // Display value shown in the wallet UI
          slug: "consensys", // Display value shown in the wallet UI
          testnet: true, // Boolean indicating whether the chain is a testnet or mainnet
          chain: "ConsenSys zkEVM Testnet", // Name of the network
          name: "ConsenSys zkEVM Testnet", // Name of the network
        },
      ]}
    >
      <YourApp />
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
};
```

### Override RPC URLs

Override the deafult RPC URL (or any other property) for a given network.

:::info Optional
By default, the SDK provides a free-to-use RPC. No configuration required!

[View the default RPC URLs for each network](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/js/blob/main/packages/auth/src/evm/evm.ts).
:::

Using the [spread syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax),
you can any properties of the chain, such as the `rpc` field.

```jsx
import { ThirdwebProvider } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider
      network={Dogechain.chainId}
      // highlight-start
      chains={[
        {
          ...Dogechain,
          rpc: ["https://<your-rpc-to-use>.com"], // Override the "rpc" field.
          // ... Override any other fields you want to customize.
        },
      ]}
      // highlight-end
    >
      <YourApp />
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
};
```
