Hook for declaring an instance of a type-safe Contract object.

```jsx
import { useContract } from "@thirdweb-dev/react"
```

### Usage

```jsx
const { contract, isLoading, error } = useContract("{{contract_address}}", "contract-type");
```

### Return Value 

```jsx
{
  contract?: SmartContract
  error?: Error
  isIdle: boolean
  isLoading: boolean
  isFetching: boolean
  isSuccess: boolean
  isError: boolean
  isFetched: boolean
  isFetchedAfterMount: boolean
  isRefetching: boolean
  refetch: (options: {
      throwOnError: boolean
      cancelRefetch: boolean
  }) => Promise<{SmartContract}>
  status: 'idle' | 'error' | 'loading' | 'success'
}
```

### Configuration

### Contract Type (optional)

If your contract is one of [thirdweb's contracts](https://thirdweb.com/explore), you can pass the name of the prebuilt contract to get better type interference and top-level functions.

```jsx
const { contract, isLoading, error } = useContract("{{contract_address}}", "contract-type");
```

:::tip Contract type options:
  "custom"
  | "edition-drop"
  | "edition"
  | "marketplace"
  | "marketplace-v3"
  | "multiwrap"
  | "nft-collection"
  | "nft-drop"
  | "pack"
  | "signature-drop"
  | "token-drop"
  | "token"
  | "vote"
:::

### ABI (optional)

If your contract was not deployed with thirdweb and you haven't imported it, you can provide an ABI as a second parameter.

```jsx
const { contract, isLoading, error } = useContract("{{contract_address}}", myContractABI);
```
