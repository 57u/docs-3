Hook for placing a bid on a marketplace auction listing.

Bids have several important properties:

- Cannot be canceled once placed.
- Are automatically refunded if they are outbid.
- Must be higher than the current highest bid by the percentage defined in the bid buffer BPS.
- Must be higher than the reserve price (if there is no bid yet).

```jsx
import { useMakeBid } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
```

## Usage

Provide your Marketplace contract instance from the [`useContract`](/react/hooks/usecontract) hook as the argument.

```jsx
import { useMakeBid, useContract, Web3Button } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress, "marketplace");
  const { mutateAsync: makeBid, isLoading, error } = useMakeBid(contract);

  return (
    <Web3Button
      contractAddress={contractAddress}
      action={() =>
        makeBid({
          listingId: "1", // ID of the listing to bid on. Must be an auction.
          bid: "1", // Uses the currencyContractAddress of the listing.
        })
      }
    >
      Make Bid
    </Web3Button>
  );
}
```
