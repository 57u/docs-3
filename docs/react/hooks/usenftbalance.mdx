Hook to get the quantity a user owns of a specific ERC1155 NFT.

Available to use on smart contracts that implement the [ERC1155](/contractkit/interfaces/erc1155) standard.

```jsx
import { useNFTBalance } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
```

## Usage

Provide your NFT collection contract and the wallet address of the owner.

For ERC1155 collections, provide the token ID as the third argument.

```jsx
import { useNFTBalance, useContract } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress);
  const { isLoading, data, error } = useNFTBalance(
    contract,
    "{{wallet_address}}",
    "{{token_id}}",
  );
}
```

## Return Value

The hook's `data` property, once loaded, returns a `BigNumber` representing the quantity of the NFT owned by the wallet.

```jsx
BigNumber;
```
