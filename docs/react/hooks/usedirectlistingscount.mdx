To get the count of all direct listings, provide your Marketplace v3 contract instance as
an argument to the hook.

```jsx
import { useDirectListingsCount, useContract } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress, "marketplace-v3");
  const {
    data: listingsCount,
    isLoading,
    error,
  } = useDirectListingsCount(contract);
}
```

## Return Value

The hook's `data` property, once loaded, is a `BigNumber` containing the number of direct listings on the Marketplace V3 contract.
