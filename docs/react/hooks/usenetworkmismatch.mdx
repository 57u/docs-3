Hook for checking whether the connected wallet is on the correct network specified by the `network` passed to the `<ThirdwebProvider />`.

```jsx
import { useNetworkMismatch } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
```

## Usage

Check if a users wallet is connected to the correct chain ID as follows:

```jsx
import { useNetworkMismatch } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const App = () => {
  const isMismatched = useNetworkMismatch();

  return <div>{isMismatched}</div>;
};
```

From here, you can prompt users to switch their network using the [`useNetwork`](/react/hooks/useNetwork) hook.

## Return value

Returns `true` if the chainId of the connected wallet is different from the chainId of the network passed into `<ThirdwebProvider />`.
