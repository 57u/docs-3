Hook for checking whether the connected wallet is currently on the correct chain,
i.e. the chain specified in the `activeChain` on the `<ThirdwebProvider />`.

```jsx
import { useNetworkMismatch } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
```

## Usage

Check if a users wallet is connected to the correct chain ID as follows:

```jsx
import { useNetworkMismatch } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const App = () => {
  const isMismatched = useNetworkMismatch();
};
```

Using this value, you can prompt users to switch their network using the [`useNetwork`](/react/hooks/useNetwork) hook.

## Return value

Returns `true` if the `chainId` of the connected wallet is different from the `chainId` of the `activeChain` passed into `<ThirdwebProvider />`.
