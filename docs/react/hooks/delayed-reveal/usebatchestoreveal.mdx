Hook for fetching batches of lazy-minted NFTs that were set to be revealed at a later date, but have not yet been revealed.

Available for contracts that implement the [Delayed reveal](/contractkit/extension-contracts/delayedreveal) interface, such as the [NFT Drop](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/DropERC721).

```jsx
import { useBatchesToReveal } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
```

## Usage

Provide your NFT collection smart contract as the argument.

```jsx
import { useBatchesToReveal, useContract } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

function App() {
  // Contract must implement the Delayed reveal interface.
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress);
  const { data: batches, isLoading, error } = useBatchesToReveal(contract);

  if (isLoading) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  if (error) {
    console.error("failed to fetch batches to reveal", error);
  }

  if (!batches) {
    return <div>No batches to reveal</div>;
  }

  return <div>Batches to reveal: {batches.length}</div>;
}
```

## Return Value

The hook's `data` property, once loaded, contains an array of batches that need to be revealed.

Each batch is an object with the following properties:

```jsx
{
  batchId: BigNumber;
  batchUri: string;
  placeholderMetadata: NFTMetadata;
}
```
