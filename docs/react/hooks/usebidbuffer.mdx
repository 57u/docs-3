Hook for determining the current bid buffer on a marketplace contract.

The bid buffer is what percentage higher the next bid must be than the current highest bid.

Available to use on marketplace contracts.

```jsx
import { useBidBuffer } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
```

## Usage

Provide your marketplace contract as the first argument, and the listing ID as the second argument.

```jsx
import { useBidBuffer, useContract } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";
// Listing ID to get the bid buffer for
const listingId = 1;

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress, "marketplace");
  const {
    data: bidBuffer,
    isLoading,
    error,
  } = useBidBuffer(contract, listingId);

  if (error) {
    console.error("failed to get bid buffer", error);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <p>The current bid buffer is {bidBuffer?.toString() ?? ""}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Return Value

The hook's `data` property, once loaded, contains the following properties:

```jsx
bidBuffer: BigNumber;
```

The `bidBuffer` value returned is in percentage format. For example, a value of `500` means that the next bid must be 5% higher than the current highest bid.
