Hook for canceling an existing auction or listing on a marketplace contract.

**Note**: Auction listings cannot be canceled if a bid has been placed.

```jsx
import { useCancelListing } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
```

## Usage

Provide your marketplace contract as the argument.

```jsx
import { useCancelListing, useContract, Web3Button } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
import { ListingType } from "@thirdweb-dev/sdk";

// Your smart contract address
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress, "marketplace");
  const {
    mutateAsync: cancelListing,
    isLoading,
    error,
  } = useCancelListing(contract);

  return (
    <Web3Button
      contractAddress={contractAddress}
      action={() =>
        cancelListing({
          id: "{{listing_id}}",
          type: ListingType.Direct, // Direct or Auction
        })
      }
    >
      Cancel Listing
    </Web3Button>
  );
}
```
