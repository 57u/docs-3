Hook for accepting an offer from a direct listing.

Allows the seller _(the user who listed the NFT for sale)_ to accept an offer on their listing.

This process will trigger a sale event, meaning the:

- NFT(s) are transferred from the seller to the buyer,
- Funds from the offeror are sent to the seller.

```jsx
import { useAcceptDirectListingOffer } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
```

## Usage

Provide a `Marketplace` contract instance from the [`useContract`](/docs/react/react.usecontract) hook as the first argument.

Provide the:

- `listingId`: the ID of the listing you wish to accept the offer for.
- `addressOfOfferor`: the wallet address of the offeror.

```jsx
import {
  useAcceptDirectListingOffer,
  useContract,
  Web3Button,
} from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress, "marketplace");
  const {
    mutateAsync: acceptDirectOffer,
    isLoading,
    error,
  } = useAcceptDirectListingOffer(contract);

  if (error) {
    console.error("failed to accept direct offer", error);
  }

  return (
    <Web3Button
      contractAddress={contractAddress}
      action={() =>
        acceptDirectOffer({
          listingId: "{{listing_id}}",
          addressOfOfferor: "{{offeror_address}}",
        })
      }
    >
      Accept Offer
    </Web3Button>
  );
}
```

## Configuration

### listingId

The `listingId` of the listing you wish to accept.

Each listing has a unique `listingId` on the marketplace contract.

### addressOfOfferor

The wallet address of the user who made the offer you wish to accept.

The [`useEvents`](/docs/react/useevents) hook can be used to read all `NewOffer` events on your marketplace contract.
