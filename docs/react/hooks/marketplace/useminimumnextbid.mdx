Hook for getting the minimum next bid for an auction listing in a marketplace.

Takes into account the current highest bid, and increments this amount by the bid buffer BPS to calculate the minimum next bid.

Available to use on
[Marketplace](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/Marketplace) and [MarketplaceV3](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/MarketplaceV3) contracts.

```jsx
import { useMinimumNextBid } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
```

## Usage

Provide your marketplace contract and the listing ID you wish to check as the arguments.

```jsx
import { useContract, useMinimumNextBid } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";
const listingId = 0;

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress, "marketplace");
  const { data, isLoading, error } = useMinimumNextBid(contract, listingId);
}
```

## Return Value

The hook's `data` property, once loaded, is an object containing the minimum next bid for the listing.

```jsx
{
  symbol: string;
  value: BigNumber;
  name: string;
  decimals: number;
  displayValue: string;
} | undefined
```
