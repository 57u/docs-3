Hook for placing an offer on a [Marketplace](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/Marketplace) direct listing.

```jsx
import { useMakeOffer } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
```

## Usage

Provide your Marketplace contract instance from the [`useContract`](/react/react.usecontract) hook as the argument.

Then, provide the `listingId`, `pricePerToken`, and `quantity` to the mutation.

```jsx
import { useMakeOffer, useContract, Web3Button } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress, "marketplace");
  const { mutateAsync: makeOffer, isLoading, error } = useMakeOffer(contract);

  return (
    <Web3Button
      contractAddress={contractAddress}
      action={() =>
        makeOffer({
          listingId: 1, // ID of the listing to make an offer on
          pricePerToken: 1, // Price per token to offer (in the listing's currency)
          quantity: 1, // Number of NFTs you want to buy (used for ERC1155 NFTs)
        })
      }
    >
      Make Bid
    </Web3Button>
  );
}
```
