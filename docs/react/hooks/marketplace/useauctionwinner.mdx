Available to use on [Marketplace](/contractkit/interfaces/marketplace)
or [MarketplaceV3](/contractkit/interfaces/marketplace-v3) smart contracts.

import { useAuctionWinner } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
```

## Usage

Provide your Marketplace contract and the item id as the arguments.

```jsx
import { useAuctionWinner, useContract } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress, "marketplace");
  const { data, isLoading, error } = useAuctionWinner(
    contract,
    1, // The listing id of the item that you want to get the auction winner for
  );
}
```

## Return Value

representing the address of the auction winner, or undefined if there is no winner.
