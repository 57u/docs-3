contracts.

```jsx
import { useWinningBid } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
```

## Usage

Provide your marketplace contract instance and the listing ID as arguments.

```jsx
import { useContract, useWinningBid } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your marketplace contract address
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";
// The listing ID to check
const listingId = "{{listing_id}}";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress, "marketplace");
  const { data, isLoading, error } = useWinningBid(contract, listingId);
}
```

## Return Value

The hook's `data` property, once loaded, is an object of type `Offer`, or `undefined` if no winning bid exists.

{
    /**

     */
    listingId: BigNumberish;
    /**
     * The address of the buyer who made the offer.
     */
    buyerAddress: string;
    /**
     * The quantity of tokens to be bought.
     */
    quantityDesired: BigNumberish;
    /**

     */
    pricePerToken: BigNumber;
    /**
     * The `CurrencyValue` of the listing. Useful for displaying the price information.
     */
