import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

Hook for fetching the reasons a user is not eligible to claim tokens from a drop.

For example, if the user is not in the allowlist, this hook will return `["This address is not on the allowlist."]`.

Available to use on contracts that implement a [Drop](https://portal.thirdweb.com/contractkit/extension-contracts/dropsinglephase) interface.

If the user is eligible to claim tokens, the hook will return an empty array.

```jsx
import { useClaimIneligibilityReasons } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
```

## Usage

Provide your Drop contract as the argument.

```jsx
import { useClaimIneligibilityReasons, useContract } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress);
  const { data, isLoading, error } = useClaimIneligibilityReasons(contract, {
    walletAddress: "{{wallet_address}}", // Use useAddress hook to get the user's wallet address
    quantity: 1,
  });
}
```

## Configuration

### eligibilityParams

```jsx
import { useClaimIneligibilityReasons, useContract } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress);
  // highlight-next-line
  const address = useAddress();

  const { data, isLoading, error } = useClaimIneligibilityReasons(
    contract,
    // highlight-start
    {
      walletAddress: address || "",
      quantity: 1,
    },
    // highlight-end
  );
}
```

### tokenId

When using ERC1155 contracts, provide a third argument to specify the token ID.

```jsx
import { useClaimIneligibilityReasons, useContract } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

// highlight-next-line
const tokenId = 1;

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress);
  const { data, isLoading, error } = useClaimIneligibilityReasons(
    contract,
    {
      walletAddress: "{{wallet_address}}",
      quantity: 1,
    },
    // highlight-next-line
    tokenId,
  );
}
```

## Return Value

The hook's `data` property, once loaded, contains an array of `ClaimEligibility` strings, which may be empty.

```jsx
ClaimEligibility[]

// ClaimEligibility Enum
export enum ClaimEligibility {
  NotEnoughSupply = "There is not enough supply to claim.",

  AddressNotAllowed = "This address is not on the allowlist.",

  WaitBeforeNextClaimTransaction = "Not enough time since last claim transaction. Please wait.",

  AlreadyClaimed = "You have already claimed the token.",

  NotEnoughTokens = "There are not enough tokens in the wallet to pay for the claim.",

  NoActiveClaimPhase = "There is no active claim phase at the moment. Please check back in later.",

  NoClaimConditionSet = "There is no claim condition set.",

  NoWallet = "No wallet connected.",

  Unknown = "No claim conditions found.",
}
```
