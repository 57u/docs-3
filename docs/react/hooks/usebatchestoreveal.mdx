Hook for fetching batches of tokens that need to be revealed.

This is only available for contracts that implement the [Revealable](/contractkit/interfaces/revealable) interface.

```jsx
import { useBatchesToReveal } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
```

## Usage

Provide your NFT collection contract as the argument.

```jsx
import { useBatchesToReveal, useContract } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress);
  const { data: batches, isLoading, error } = useBatchesToReveal(contract);

  if (error) {
    console.error("failed to fetch batches to reveal", error);
  }

  return <div>Batches to reveal: {batches.length}</div>;
}
```

## Returned Data

The hook will return an array of [`BatchToReveal`](/sdk/batchToReveal) objects.

```ts
export interface BatchToReveal {
  batchId: BigNumber;
  batchUri: string;
  placeholderMetadata: NFTMetadata;
}
```

Each `BatchToReveal` object has a unique `batchId` and an `batchUri` which points to an IPFS URI containing metadata for each token in the batch.

The `placeholderMetadata` property is a generic placeholder object that can be used to render a preview of the batch until it can be revealed.
